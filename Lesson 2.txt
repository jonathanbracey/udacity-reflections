What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git places a .git subdirectory in the current directory
where it will store the commit history (commit ID, author,
date, message) and code for each commit. For the time being,
after initializing a new repository, nothing is stored in the
.git subdirectory, because there are no commits (even if
there were files in the directory that 'git init' was run).


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers? 

The staging area groups together the file or files that you want to commit. 
The working directory actually holds the current copies of the files.
The repository holds the commits, which has a copy of the file at the time
the commit was made.

The staging area is useful, because it allows us to choose what to commit,
then check it with 'git status' before actually finalizing it. Without the
staging area, we could accidentally make a commit we didn't want, or we would
be unable to commit multiple files at once (if the logical changes made sense
to include in one commit). The staging area gives us more choice.
