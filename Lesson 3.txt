When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would most want to use remote repositories when collaborationg with others, so people
can work on code together, and merge it more easily. This could work well for a
collaboration between friends, or working with people online for a big project. In fact,
I could see remote repositories on GitHub being useful for finding coding opportunities,
because we can collaborate on projects with people we don't know (at least,
don't know yet). It could be a great way to garner experience, and learn a lot
from veteran coders. 
It could also be great for showing off code to others, so they can test it, and
give their impressions (likes, dislikes, bugs found, new features). As new 
features are created, new branches can be made till that feature is bug-free, and 
working as intended. This type of public coding could allow others with the 
knowledge and desire to potentially jump in, make some changes (additions,
optimizations, etc.), and present them to original coder. All that could lead
to the original coder learning something from a veteran coder (as seen above).

Working with, and learning from, others seems to be the biggest positives for me.
I suppose it make sense for teaching others to be added, too.
